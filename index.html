                    Michael Jeffrey Jordan (born February 17, 1963), also known by his initials, MJ,
                    is an American former
                    professional basketball player,entrepreneur, and majority owner and chairman of the Charlotte Bobcats.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His biography on the National Basketball Association (NBA) website states, "By acclamation, Michael
                    Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jordan was one of the most effectively marketed
                    athletes of his generation and was considered instrumental in popularizing the NBA around the world in
                    the 1980s and 1990s.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After a three-season career at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he was a member of
                    the Tar Heels' national championship team in 1982, Jordan joined the NBA's Chicago Bulls in 1984.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He quickly emerged as a league star, entertaining crowds with his prolific scoring.
                    His leaping ability, illustrated by performing slam dunks from the free throw line in slam dunk contests, earned him the
                    nicknames "Air Jordan" and "His Airness".
                </p>
                <p>
                    He also gained a reputation for being one of the best defensive players in basketball.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1991, he won his first NBA championship with the Bulls, and followed that achievement with titles in 1992 and 1993, securing a "three-peat".
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although Jordan abruptly retired from basketball at the beginning of the 1993–94 NBA season to pursue a career in baseball, he rejoined
                    the Bulls in 1995 and led them to three additional championships in 1996, 1997, and 1998, as well as an
                    NBA-record 72 regular-season wins in the 1995–96 NBA season.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jordan retired for a second time in 1999, but returned for two more NBA seasons from 2001 to 2003 as a member of the Washington
                    Wizards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jordan's individual accolades and accomplishments include five Most Valuable Player (MVP) Awards,
                    ten All-NBA First Team designations, nine All-Defensive First Team honors, fourteen NBA All-Star

                    for highest career regular season scoring average (30.12 points per game) and highest career playoff
                    scoring average (33.45 points per game).
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1999, he was named the greatest North American athlete of
                    the 20th century by ESPN, and was second to Babe Ruth on the Associated Press's list of athletes of the
                    century.

                </p>
                <p>

                    film Space Jam as himself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He is the majority owner and head of basketball operations for the
                    NBA's Charlotte Bobcats, having won a bidding war to buy controlling interest in the team from founding
                    owner Robert L. Johnson.
